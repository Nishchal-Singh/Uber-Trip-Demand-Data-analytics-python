# Uber-Trip-Demand-Data-analytics-python
Project Summary:

Analyzed 4.5M+ Uber trip records from NYC (April - Sept 2014) to uncover demand patterns & peak hours.

Performed time series resampling and seasonal decomposition to visualize hourly trip trends.

Engineered lag features to capture temporal dependencies for ride demand forecasting.

Built and optimized predictive models using XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees.

Developed an ensemble model, improving forecast accuracy (MAPE: 8.6%).

Visualized results with Matplotlib & Seaborn for actionable business insights.
